         <h1>About The Movie</h1>
         <p>The primary goal of this section is to answer the following question: what movie content results in the most successful movies? The following figures depict specific information about the movie content to help answer this question.</p>
         <h3>Heroes Versus Gross Income</h3>
         <iframe src="fig7.html" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto; width: 80%; height: 600px; border: none;"></iframe>
         <p>The figure depicts the aggregate inflation-adjusted gross income of Disney movies, grouped by character type, and compares the gross income of Hero & Villain, Villain Only, and Hero Only categories. The Hero Only category owns the lowest amount of gross income. When comparing the remaining two categories, movies that feature both a hero and a villain generate more total gross income than the villain-only movies. However, the individual villain-only movies earn more than a lot of the hero-and-villain movies. An insight from this is that, while Villain Only movies have the potential to earn a large gross income, the greater prevalence of the Hero & Villain category makes it so it collectively generates the most income. </p>
         <h3>Key to Adventure Genre</h3>
         <iframe src="fig20.html" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto; width: 80%; height: 600px; border: none;"></iframe>
         <p>The next figure further focuses on a genre that has been the most successful in the more recent decades: adventure. This figure is trying to give insight to what character types the popular adventure category has. The figure is further broken down into decades for easier comparison. The figure shows that more movies in the adventure category have a Hero & a Villain across all of the decades. This reinforces a key idea: the highest grossing films are adventure movies with both a Hero & a Villain. This appears to be the most recent most successful structure of the movie.</p>
         <h3>Song vs No Song Across The Decades</h3>
         <iframe src="fig12.html" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto; width: 80%; height: 600px; border: none;"></iframe>
         <p>This figure depicts the average inflation-adjusted income across the decades, sorted by whether or not there is a song associated with the movie (blue means there is, red means there is not). The goal of this figure is to answer the question of whether having a song or not results in a more successful movie. The data is broken up by decade to allow for more clear comparisons. Based on the data, generally, having a song associated with the movie results in the movie earning a higher average income. One notable expectation is that in 1940, the average income for movies with a song and without a song were equal, but for the other decades where there were movies without songs associated with them, the songs category outperformed the no songs category. This indicates that having songs in Disney movies result in a better performing movie.</p>
