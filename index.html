         <h1>Most Successful Disney Movie Analysis</h1>
         <p>This project set out to answer the question: What makes the most successful Disney movie? We took a look at a representative example of Disney movies to answer this question. Success is a metric defined by movies that earned the most inflation adjusted income. We analyzed the data to isolate specific characteristics of movies in order to find the most revenue generating combinations.</p>
         <h1>Key Takeaways</h1>
         <p>A main key takeaway that we got from this data is that the characteristics that made a movie successful changed throughout time. Continuously changing cultural trends and media interests changes what makes a movie popular.   </p>
         <h6>Through the Decades</h6>
         <p>The key takeaway from this section is that the most successful decades were the 1930s and 1940s, which were followed by a steady decline before they increased again in the modern day. Movies in the earlier decades met success with their G rated Musicals and Adventure movies. Decreasing revenue in the decades past caused Disney to pivot to focusing more on producing PG and G adventure movies, which helped increase their revenue once more.</p>
         <h6>Movie Logistics</h6>
         <p>The key takeaway from this section is that the most successful movies had the following logistics: Adventure PG movies released during the holiday months. Movies with one or more of these logistical characteristics generated more gross revenue.</p>
         <h6>About the Movie</h6>
         <p>The key takeaway from this section is that the most successful Disney movies are structured to include songs and both a hero and a villain. Throughout the decades, these features trademarked success time and time again. Additionally, in a high revenue generating genre, Adventure was structured in a way to include a characteristic associated with success: having both a Hero & a Villain.</p>
