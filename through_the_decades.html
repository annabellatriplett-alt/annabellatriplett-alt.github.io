         <h1>Through The Decades</h1>
         <p>The primary goal of this section is to answer the questions: Which decade did the best? What were some characteristics of movies that contributed to each decades income? The following four figures break down these questions to give key insights. </p>
         <h3>Decade with Inflation Adjusted Income</h3>
         <iframe src="fig11.html" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto; width: 80%; height: 600px; border: none;"></iframe>
         <p>This figure shows the average inflation-adjusted income throughout this sample of Disney movies made across each decade. The figure depicts a general trend of decreasing revenue from 1930 to 1970. The figure then depicts an exponential increase over the next three decades, followed by a drop in 2000 and a rise again in 2010. One possible explanation for the peak in gross income being in 1930 was because at that time, theaters were one of the largest mass entertainment industries, and thus there was lower entertainment market competition. As televisions and radios became more accessible over the next few decades, Disney experienced greater competition due to the more desirable market. The resurgence of income that came after the 1970s can be explained by the success of Disney movies in their “Disney Renaissance Era,” which peaked in the 1990s. From this figure, it can be determined that the 1930s decade did the best.</p>
         <h3>Rating Across Decades</h3>
         <iframe src="fig2.html" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto; width: 80%; height: 600px; border: none;"></iframe>
         <p>The bar chart above shows the number of movies with specific MPAA ratings per decade. The differing colors each represent a different rating, where blue is G, red is not rated, and green is PG. The figure shows that the movies produced up until 1980 were almost all G, with the exception of the 1960s, where the sample in that decade was not rated. The figure depicts PG-rated movies starting to appear in the 1990s, and over the next few decades the number of movies rated PG increased as the number of movies rated G decreased. Comparing the changes in MPAA ratings to the first figure, the relatively steady G rating corresponding to the decreasing gross income indicates that the continuity of the G ratings resulted in success in earlier decades, but could have become repetitive in the continuing decades. The increase in gross income follows the trend of increasing PG ratings, which can indicate the introduction of new ratings helped the latter decades be more successful than the last few before it.</p>
         <h3>Genre Success Across Decades</h3>
         <iframe src="fig3.html" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto; width: 80%; height: 600px; border: none;"></iframe>
         <p>This bar chart depicts the inflation adjusted gross income of various movie genres across the decades. Each color represents a different movie genre, specified on the legend. In the 1930s, Disney movie income, from the movies in this sample, was exclusively from musicals. In the following decade, the gross revenue was evenly split between Musical and Adventure movies. The 1950s depict a turn away from both of those categories with Dramas. The 1960s and 1970s depict a return to Musical and Adventure movies, but with a significant drop in gross income compared to the 1940s Adventure and Musical movies. The figure shows comedies beginning to generate a small amount of revenue starting in the 1980s, which stays fairly consistent over the next two decades. Adventure movies became the main revenue genre from 1980-2010, and shows a generally increasing trend of revenue from 1980 to 2010. A key insight from this figure is that Disney was able to capitalize off of Musical popularity in the 1930s, contributing to the success of the decade. As musicals became less revenue earning for Disney, their turn to different genres can be indicative of their attempts to pivot into a more successful genre market. The spike in adventure movies produced (as shown by the lines on the bars in the figure) corresponds to an increase in revenue, indicating that eventually Disney was able to pivot to a more successful genre.</p>
         <h3>Average Gross Income Per Year, Not Inflation Adjusted</h3>
         <iframe src="fig4.html" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto; width: 80%; height: 600px; border: none;"></iframe>
         <p>This figure depicts the total gross, non inflation adjusted, revenue Disney movies generated across each decade. There is a general decreasing trend from 1930-1970, and then a generally increasing trend from 1970 to 2010, with the two trend outliers being 1960 and 1990. While it is important to look at the inflation adjusted income to determine which decade did the best, the total, non-flation adjusted gross income helps give insight into industry characteristics that could have played a role in influencing the success and failures of certain decades. Both the inflation and non-inflation adjusted data reflects the same downward trend, indicating that the characteristics of a lower success rate may reflect a more broad economic downturn. The expansion in total gross income past the 1970s may reflect an expansion in the film industry, which is a characteristic that can factor into the inflation-adjusted success of each decade.</p>
